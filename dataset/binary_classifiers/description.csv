https://github.com/XiaLiPKU/RESCAN,Allen Mao,"Rain streaks can severely degrade the visibility, which causes many current computer vision algorithms fail to work. So it is necessary to remove the rain from images. We propose a novel deep network architecture based on deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks for single image deraining. As contextual information is very important for rain removal, we first adopt the dilated convolutional neural network to acquire large receptive field. To better fit the rain removal task, we also modify the network. In heavy rain, rain streaks have various directions and shapes, which can be regarded as the accumulation of multiple rain streak layers. We assign different alpha-values to various rain streak layers according to the intensity and transparency by incorporating the squeeze-and-excitation block. Since rain streak layers overlap with each other, it is not easy to remove the rain in one stage. So we further decompose the rain removal into multiple stages. Recurrent neural network is incorporated to preserve the useful information in previous stages and benefit the rain removal in later stages. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under all evaluation metrics."

https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,What is it
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"GemPy is a Python-based, open-source library for implicitly generating 3D structural geological models. It is capable of constructing complex 3D geological models of folded structures, fault networks and unconformities. It was designed from the ground up to support easy embedding in probabilistic frameworks for the uncertainty analysis of subsurface structures."
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,Features
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,The core algorithm of GemPy is based on a universal cokriging interpolation method devised by Lajaunie et al. (1997) and extended by Calcagno et al. (2008). Its implicit nature allows the user to automatically generate complex 3D structural geological models through the interpolation of input data:

https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,Orientation measurements: Orientation of the poles perpendicular to the dipping of surfaces at any point in the 3D space.
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,GemPy also allows for the definition of topological elements such as combining multiple stratigraphic sequences and complex fault networks to be considered in the modeling process.
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"GemPy itself offers direct visualization of 2D model sections via matplotlib and in full, interactive 3D using the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). The VTK support also allow to the real time maniulation of the 3-D model, allowing for the exact modification of data. Models can also easily be exportes in VTK file format for further visualization and processing in other software such as ParaView."
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"GemPy was designed from the beginning to support stochastic geological modeling for uncertainty analysis (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations, Bayesian inference). This was achieved by writing GemPy's core architecture using the numerical computation library Theano to couple it with the probabilistic programming framework PyMC3. This enables the use of advanced sampling methods (e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) and is of particular relevance when considering uncertainties in the model input data and making use of additional secondary information in a Bayesian inference framework."
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"We can, for example, include uncertainties with respect to the z-position of layer boundaries in the model space. Simple Monte Carlo simulation via PyMC will then result in different model realizations:"
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"Theano allows the automated computation of gradients opening the door to the use of advanced gradient-based sampling methods coupling GeMpy and PyMC3 for advanced stochastic modeling. Also, the use of Theano allows making use of GPUs through cuda (see the Theano documentation for more information."

https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"New developments in the field of augmented reality, i.e. the superimposition of real and digital objects, offer interesting and diverse possibilities that have hardly been exploited to date. The aim of the project is therefore the development and realization of an augmented reality sandbox for interaction with geoscientific data and models. In this project, methods are to be developed to project geoscientific data (such as the outcrop of a geological layer surface or geophysical measurement data) onto real surfaces."
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"The AR Sandbox is based on a container filled with sand, the surface of which can be shaped as required. The topography of the sand surface is continuously scanned by a 3D sensor and a camera. In the computer the scanned surface is now blended with a digital geological 3D model (or other data) in real time and an image is calculated, which is projected onto the sand surface by means of a beamer. This results in an interactive model with which the user can interact in an intuitive way and which visualizes and comprehend complex three-dimensional facts in an accessible way."
https://github.com/cgre-aachen/gempy,Allen Mao,"In addition to applications in teaching and research, this development offers great potential as an interactive exhibit with high outreach for the geosciences thanks to its intuitive operation. The finished sandbox can be used in numerous lectures and public events , but is mainly used as an interface to GemPy software and for rapid prototyping of implicit geological models."

https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,Introduction
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,HyVR: Turning your geofantasy into reality!
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"The Hydrogeological Virtual Reality simulation package (HyVR) is a Python module that helps researchers and practitioners generate subsurface models with multiple scales of heterogeneity that are based on geological concepts. The simulation outputs can then be used to explore groundwater flow and solute transport behaviour. This is facilitated by HyVR outputs in common flow simulation packages' input formats. As each site is unique, HyVR has been designed that users can take the code and extend it to suit their particular simulation needs."
https://github.com/driftingtides/hyvr,Allen Mao,"The original motivation for HyVR was the lack of tools for modelling sedimentary deposits that include bedding structure model outputs (i.e., dip and azimuth). Such bedding parameters were required to approximate full hydraulic-conductivity tensors for groundwater flow modelling. HyVR is able to simulate these bedding parameters and generate spatially distributed parameter fields, including full hydraulic-conductivity tensors. More information about HyVR is available in the online technical documentation."

https://github.com/equinor/pylops,Allen Mao,"Many useful operators, however, do not lend themselves to an explicit matrix representation when used to solve large-scale problems. PyLops operators, on the other hand, still represent a matrix and can be treated in a similar way, but do not rely on the explicit creation of a dense (or sparse) matrix itself. Conversely, the forward and adjoint operators are represented by small pieces of codes that mimic the effect of the matrix on a vector or another matrix."
https://github.com/equinor/pylops,Allen Mao,"Luckily, many iterative methods (e.g. cg, lsqr) do not need to know the individual entries of a matrix to solve a linear system.

The end-to-end learning is achieved by directly embedding the atmospheric scattering model into the network, thereby ensuring that the proposed method strictly follows the physics-driven scattering model for dehazing. Inspired by the dense network that can maximize the information flow along features from different levels, we propose a new edge-preserving densely connected encoder-decoder structure with multi-level pyramid pooling module for estimating the transmission map. This network is optimized using a newly introduced edge-preserving loss function. To further incorporate the mutual structural information between the estimated transmission map and the dehazed result, we propose a joint-discriminator based on generative adversarial network framework to decide whether the corresponding dehazed image and the estimated transmission map are real or fake. An ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module evaluated at both estimated transmission map and dehazed result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods."
https://github.com/hezhangsprinter/DID-MDN,Allen Mao,"We present a novel density-aware multi-stream densely connected convolutional neural network-based algorithm, called DID-MDN, for joint rain density estimation and de-raining. The proposed method enables the network itself to automatically determine the rain-density information and then efficiently remove the corresponding rain-streaks guided by the estimated rain-density label. To better characterize rain-streaks with dif- ferent scales and shapes, a multi-stream densely connected de-raining network is proposed which efficiently leverages features from different scales. Furthermore, a new dataset containing images with rain-density labels is created and used to train the proposed density-aware network."

https://github.com/yulunzhang/RDN,Allen Mao,"A very deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has recently achieved great success for image super-resolution (SR) and offered hierarchical features as well. However, most deep CNN based SR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-resolution (LR) images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in image SR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Speci??ally, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via dense connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory (CM) mechanism. Local feature fusion in RDB is then used to adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilizes the training of wider network. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. Experiments on benchmark datasets with different degradation models show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods."

The CU-Net is a hybrid of naive dense U-Net and stacked U-Net, integrating the merits of both dense connectivity, intermediate supervisions and multi-stage top-down and bottom-up refinement. The resulted CU-Net could save ~70% parameters of the previous stacked U-Nets but with comparable accuracy."
https://github.com/zhiqiangdon/CU-Net,Allen Mao,"If we couple each U-Net pair in multiple U-Nets, the coupling connections would have quadratic growth with respect to the U-Net number. To make the model more parameter efficient, we propose the order-K coupling to trim off the long-distance coupling connections."

https://github.com/eventbrite/nose-picker,hao yang,This plugin modifies nose's unit test discovery to only pick a (1/N) subset of unit tests to run
https://github.com/eventbrite/nose-picker,hao yang,"By passing in the --total-processes arguments, you pick the denominator (the N above) which you want to run"
https://github.com/eventbrite/nose-picker,hao yang,"The --which-process argument controls which part of that subset to run, so if you had 5 subsets you could pick 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4"
https://github.com/eventbrite/nose-picker,hao yang,"How does it work? Very simple! It hashes the filenames that nose is running through, does a modulo division by N, then sees if this file is ""its"""
https://github.com/eventbrite/nose-picker,hao yang,"Very simple, but it lets you run multiple of these nose-picker enabled runners in parallel, each running a separate subset of the unit tests!"
